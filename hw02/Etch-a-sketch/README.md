Program description: User should execute main.js among the 4 JavaScript files to run the program. The other files is for implementing scanf function with JavaScript. Once program is running, prompt will show up to let user to specify the size of grid. Then user can press Top, Left, Bottom or Right button to move cursor in the grid. The location where cursor passed, a "X" will show up. User can also press the Reset Button to clean the grid.

Attention: Right now the program has a strange behavior. After executing main.js the user should wait 8~10 seconds before pressing any button to make sure this program works correctly. If user press any button within 8 seconds, the grid will not update.(Still investigating reason for this)
